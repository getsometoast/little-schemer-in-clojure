Little Schemer in Clojure
=========================

Working through each chapter of little schemer in clojure.  NB - I've never worked with Clojure or Scheme or any other LISP variant.

##Notes:

###Chapter 1
- atoms in clojure are definitely not the same as a scheme atom!
- car is first in clojure and returns the first element of a sequence.
- cdr is rest in clojure and returns a sequence minus the first element.
- cons is cons in clojure and pushes an element onto a sequenece.
- null? isn't in clojure, nil? is but doesn't seem to behave the same.
- eq isn't in clojure, = is but doesn't behave the same.
